    privacy of all our users. We take our duty to process your personal data very seriously. This policy represents our
    commitment to your right to privacy, giving you a clear explanation about how we use your information and your

  <H5>Scope of Privacy Policy</H5>
  <p>This privacy policy applies only to your use of our Tezos digital wallet, Kukai. Our website may contain links to
    other websites, which are not hosted by Kukai. Please note that we have no control over how your data is collected,
    stored, or used by other websites and we advise you to check the privacy policies of any such websites before
    providing any data to them.</p>

  <H5>What types of information do we collect and how?</H5>
  <p>Kukai does not normally keep, process, or store any user data, however some services that Kukai relies on, or use
    other Kukai services, may store email address or social username, including services designed by Kukai for NFT
    (“non-fungible token”) drops or releases. Kukai uses Cloudflare services, which collects anonymized website traffic
    data. In limited circumstances, users who use Kukai through a NFT drop or release, may have their data temporarily
    stored in a queue system for a period of two weeks (2) before the data is completely erased. The purpose of the
    queue system is to ensure proper processing of transactions by the order they are submitted. Once the NFT drop or
    release is completed or two weeks have passed, whatever comes first, users’ data in the queue system will be
    completely erased.</p>

  <p>Data protection laws require us to have a legal justification to process your personal information. Please note,
    that to use Kukai digital wallet, no personal information is needed to use or access our website or to use our
    digital wallet. Once again, Kukai does not store user data on any servers.</p>

    obligations placed upon us, through a lawfully valid legal order by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
